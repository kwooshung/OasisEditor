# Why Develop It?

- There are numerous **WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors** in the community, and many of them are outstanding. However, based on my usage and testing, they all have **various shortcomings** that make them unsuitable for me;
- In my opinion, Yuque's **LakexEditor** is currently the best editor. Although it has an open-source version, it's semi-open source at the moment. Its strong coupling with **AntDesign** makes it less applicable for general use.

# Why Use It?

- Supports bilingual annotations in both Chinese and English;
- Low learning curve, easy to use;
- Implemented with modern features of **ES6**;
- Written in **TypeScript** for type safety;
- Headless, no UI, allowing for a unified website design style;
- Customizable, supports writing your own plugins, with simple plugin development;
- Pure script, can depend on any framework, any platform, any environment;
- Supports on-demand import, `esm` modularization, natively supports **tree-shaking**, no worries about the size after packaging;
- Of course, this project also provides a `commonjs` standard `cjs` version;
- Test coverage of **100%**.
